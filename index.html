  <h1>Homework 8, Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval</h1>

  <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Your Name">

  <p>The goal of this homework project was to practice using SQLAlchemy to
     query databases for information relavent to analyzing climate trends in
     Hawaii.
  </p>

  <p>One of the components of this assignment was to use a query to retrieve
     the total amounts of rainfall recorded by the nine weather stations that
     contributed data to the assignment database for the a period of time one
     year prior to a range of dates we chose for a potential trip to Hawaii.
     When I performed this portion of the assignment, the query I used only
     returned data from five of the nine stations. I was concerened that I <head>
     designed my query wrong, so I decided to write another query to retrieve
     the last dates of data recroded by each station.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is a table of the dates of last recorded data for each of the nine
    stations.
